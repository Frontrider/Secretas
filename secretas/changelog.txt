Version: 1.0.16
Date: 2. 24. 2025
  Major Features:
    - Fixed typo on Golden biter egg. Thanks Kewlchicken
    - Science pack productivity now only parses the default lab
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.15
Date: 2. 18. 2025
  Major Features:
    - Updated how updating inserter belt stack sizes is handled, thanks Pthread-Create
    - Robot worker storage capacity research 4+ added. (Not infinite)
    - Hyper inserters now classified as bulk inserters, and default belt stack size is increased to 5 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.14
Date: 2. 17. 2025
  Major Features:
    - Fixed a bug to ensure that stack-inserters can actually use an additional level of belt capacity. Thanks Pthread-Create for bringing it to my attention.
    - Rebalanced hyper inserter crafting recipe. It is much more expensive to balance its power. And to think twice before replacing every inserter with this beast.
    - Hyper inserter has a lower rocket stack capacity. (Now 35 kg)
    - Hyper inserter rotation speed lowered to 0.07 from 0.08
    - Hyper inserter power consumption increased to 70kJ for movement. (Stack inserter is 40kJ for reference)
    - Hyper inserter health increased to 170
    - Hyper inserter stack_size_bonus reduced to 8 from 16. (Stack inserter is 4)
    - Hyper inserter now has a max_belt_stack_size of 2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.13
Date: 2. 11. 2025
  Major Features:
    - Rebalanced Golden-Science pack recipe, such that you need to craft it on Frozeta.
    - It is now crafting-with-fluid-or-metallurgy, and takes steam. So now you actually have to either conquer Frozeta to craft the science pack, or import everything, 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.12
Date: 2. 05. 2025
  Bugfixes:
    - Merged Talandar99's pull request, adding translations and recipe duplication
    - Fixed order for modules. Thanks Pthread-Create
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.11
Date: 2. 05. 2025
  Bugfixes:
    - Prevents Frozeta from stealing Aquino's music.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.10
Date: 1. 02. 2025
  Bugfixes:
    - Removed quality effect from level 4 quality modules. Thanks nicklas-dohrn for the PR!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.9
Date: 30. 01. 2025
  Major Features:
    - France localization. Thanks Fr-Fae.
    - integrated pull request. Thanks  Atraxi. PR fixes science-pack-productivity research. 
    - Frontrider generated some images using AI. They are now integrated. Thanks!
    - Should be able to be integrated into Kryzeth's all planet mod pack.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.8
Date: 29. 01. 2025
  Major Features:
    - Added localization for achievements.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.7
Date: 29. 01. 2025
  Major Features:
    - Added setting to disable behavior that handles adding all science packs to science-pack-productivity
    - Golden biter egg recipe now enabled. My bad. Thanks nicklasDohrn for bringing it my attention.
    - Renamed named transport-belt-capacity-3 to transport-belt-capacity-3_Secretas. I wrote a migration for this but I am not sure why it doesn't work. This should ensure compatibility for infinite belt stacking mod.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.6
Date: 28. 01. 2025
  Major Features:
    - data-updates.lua now modified science-pack-productivity technology. It adds all science packs available as both an input requirement, and a change-recipe-productivity effect. This means no matter how many mods add new science, there will always be at least one research that uses all of them. One day, I might figure out settings so you could exclude any other mods science pack. But for now, it works.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.5
Date: 28. 01. 2025
  Major Features:
    - Achievements for visiting Frozeta, gold production, making level 4 modules, and researching with gold
    - Migrated level 4 modules to have an S. Ex productivity-module-4 --> productivity-module-4-S . This ensures I play nicely with whoever else adds level 4 modules. I won't change my -S postfix. 
    - Adjusted how much solid fuel you get from space scrap. I'll update the GitHub, but this will be noted in patch notes next time, as I am tired and just resubmitted.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.4
Date: 27. 01. 2025
  Major Features:
    - Gold textures now pretty
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.3
Date: 25. 01. 2025
  Major Features:
    - Rebalanced scrap recycling to relieve pressure on solid fuel.
    - Added solid fuel liquefaction recipe. Should now be possible to make heavy oil with a seed of heavy oil. Now possible to make rocket fuel. Not having a chain for rocket fuel production was a fupa on my end. Sorry!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.2
Date: 23. 01. 2025
  Bugfixes:
    - Not enough recycler slots to receive all potential scrap outputs. Didn't realize all those slots were necessary at first. Thanks to Semenanr for bringing this to my attention. Steam recycler and vanilla recycler now have 40 output slots, so you can now get all outputs from spaceship scrap!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.1
Date: 22. 01. 2025
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed incorrect sprite on steam recycler recipe, thanks  cackling.fiend
    - Fixed missing localizations, thanks  cackling.fiend
    - Thinking about how to best approach interned compatibility for mods that add new science so they benefit from the research "Science pack productivity"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.0
Date: 21. 1. 2025
  Major Features:
    - Initial release.
